**🚨 ALPHA ALERT 🚨**

**People are asking for alpha, so here's a little something to get you started.** We're dropping a **fat stack of tokens** on the NFT fam, and it's gonna be **raining $LEGEND**. 💰🌧

But look deeper and peep the tokenomics, and you'll transcend to **Vince McMahon laser eyes level hype**:

**Allocation Category:**

**[Redacted]†**: **12.5%** (a whopping **525,871,177 tokens**) - **[Redacted]**.

In short? This stash is for the 💎🤲 **OGs clutching onto The Choice** like it's their last hope. We're talking about raining millions upon millions of tokens, outta nowhere. The more badass The Choice you end up choosing is†, the fatter the drop you're gonna catch. And yeah, **Minter's**† getting a piece of the action too with some juicy prizes and whatnot.

We're all about hyping up **Solana**, backing its big moves, major airdrops, and all those fire partner launches. It's an endless party here, and our NFT fam is gonna be drowning in tokens while we boost Solana to the stratosphere.

And yo, keep this on the DL, but if you're smart, you'll **rush towards The Choice like it's solid gold**. Why? 'Cause we've got a sneaky **5% tucked away for the epic Saga 2 rollout**†. Mum's the word, but this is the kinda intel that makes lettuce virgin hands (as the Chads would say), into **diamond fists of fury**. ✊💎

\* **Minter** is alpha for an app that we've got in testing that's going to change the game for Solana NFT projects. It's a secret for now, but we're dropping hints like breadcrumbs. Keep your eyes peeled for more info. 🕵️‍♂️🍞
